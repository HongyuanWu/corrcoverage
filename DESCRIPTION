Description: Using a computationally efficient method, the package can
    be used to find the "corrected coverage estimate" of a credible set 
    of putative causal variants from Bayesian genetic fine-mapping. 
    The package can also be used to obtain a "corrected credible set" 
    if required; that is, the smallest set of variants required such 
    that the corrected coverage estimate of the resultant credible set is  
    within some user defined accuracy of the desired coverage.
