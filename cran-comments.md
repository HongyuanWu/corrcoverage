## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated description field in DESCRIPTION remove incorrect quotation marks. 

* Updated authors of functions and correctly added these in the 
  Authors@R field with the appropriate roles. Note that Claudia 
  Giambartolomei is no author or contributor of any kind.
